## Introduction

Photography is the art of capturing light to create images. Understanding how your camera works and the basic principles of photography will help you take better photos.

## Basic Camera Settings

The three main camera settings you need to understand are:

```plaintext
1. Aperture (f-stop)
2. Shutter Speed
3. ISO
```

Here's a simple JavaScript function to calculate the exposure value:

```javascript
const calculateExposureValue = (aperture, shutterSpeed, iso) => {
  // EV = log2(apertureÂ²) - log2(shutterSpeed) - log2(iso/100)
  return Math.log2(Math.pow(aperture, 2)) - Math.log2(shutterSpeed) - Math.log2(iso/100);
};
```

## Composition Rules

1. Rule of Thirds
2. Leading Lines
3. Symmetry and Patterns
4. Framing

## Lighting Techniques

Understanding light is crucial for photography. Here are the main types of lighting:

- Natural Light
- Artificial Light
- Diffused Light
- Hard Light

Remember, these are just guidelines. Once you understand the rules, you can break them creatively to develop your own style.
